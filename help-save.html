<h1>Help - Save State</h1>

<p>
The assembly viewer allows the visual state of the viewer to be preserved,
and used as the startup for a future startup.  The items that are saved are
the visibility of parts, the rotation, zoom and pan, and well as the added
links.
<p>

<p>  
The save data is an XML file which is placed on the server with the STEP
assembly data.  At present we have not yet implemented the server-side
support, so you will need to manually place the save file in the directory
containing the data.  (This requires write access to the server.)  The <b>Save
State</b> button creates a popup containing the XML to save.  Copy and past
this XML data into a file and save it.  If you do not have write access to the
server, you can create your own setup, using
the <a href="stpidx_client.zip">Javascript source</a> and data published 
<a href="index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The nodes of the assembly tree can be annotated with hypertext links.  These
links can refer to other parts in the STEP archive, or to any other document
of the web.  To edit the links, select the <b>Enable Edit Links</b> checkbox,
and then click on the <b>[Links]</b> tag in the assembly pane.  This will give
you a popup where you can add edit or remove links to the assembly component.
